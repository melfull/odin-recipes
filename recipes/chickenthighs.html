<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Air fryer chicken thighs are super juicy with extra crispy skin, and they only take about 20 minutes to cook to perfection!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
  <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>1/8 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp Freshly cracked pepper</li>
  <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2.25 lbs.)</li>
  <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cayenne, salt, and pepper.</li>
  <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400ºF. Pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel.</li>
  <li>Place the chicken thighs in a bowl and drizzle the cooking oil over top, then add the cornstarch and seasoning mixture. Toss the chicken thighs until they are well coated in oil and spices.</li>
  <li>Place the chicken thighs in the air fryer basket, skin side up, and cook for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken thighs and cook for 8 minutes more.</li>
  <li>Flip one last time so the skin side is up and cook for two minutes. Use a meat thermometer to make sure the internal temperature has reached 165ºF, and if not, cook for 1-2 minutes longer. Serve the chicken thighs hot with your favorite simple sides!</li>
